#### Create - useMutation to Create Items

###### Aside: Forms in React

Greatly simplified with the `useReducer` hook. Destructure `formState`, and `setFormState` from `useReducer`. The first parameter for `useReducer` is a the state updater function. The second parameter to `useReducer` is an object that defines the inital value of `formState`.

```javascript
const [formState, setFormState] = useReducer(
  (state, action) => ({ ...state, ...action }),
  {
    title: "Testing the Form",
    description: "Testing the Form",
    image: "",
    largeImage: "",
    price: 100,
  }
)
```

The `handleChange` function follows a similar pattern to previous versions of React. It calls the `setFormState` function destructured from our `useReducer` hook, and uses [computed property names](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer#Computed_property_names) to update the appropriate property of `formState` with the new value. This allows us to use a single `handleChange` function for all form inputs.

```javascript
const handleChange = e => {
  const { name, type, value } = e.target
  const val = type === "number" ? parseFloat(value) : value
  // handleChange call setFormState, changing the value of the formState
  // Object so that the new value will equal the previousValue, but with the /// selected field's(see [name]) value changed based on userInput(see val)
  setFormState({ ...formState, [name]: val })
}
```

###### Creating Items

Write a Query using `graphql-tag`'s `gql` function. `gql` wraps a javascript string, and translates it into GraphQL(remember that's Graph Query **Language**) using an AST. Then pass that `gql` query into Apollo Client's `useMutation` hook, and return different markup from your component based on whether the resulting payload contains `loading`, `error`, or `data`. We then take our `formState` object defined above and use it to call the `createItem` function

1. Define the Mutation

- Define the variable in JavaScript
- Names the mutation for the AST, and lists the variables that will be passed into it, and their value types.
- Exposes those variables to our `createItem` Mutation on the backend.
- Ask for some data back after the Mutation is complete.

```javascript
export const CREATE_ITEM_MUTATION = gql`
  mutation CREATE_ITEM_MUTATION(
    $title: String!
    $description: String!
    $price: Int!
    $image: String
    $largeImage: String!
  ) {
    createItem(
      title: $title
      description: $description
      price: $price
      image: $image
      largeImage: $largeImage
    ) {
      id
    }
  }
`
```

2. Pass the `CREATE_ITEM_MUTATION` to Apollo Client's `useMutation` hook.

2a. Destructure the `createItem` function from that hook, so we can call that function as a part of our `handleSubmit` function.

2b. Use ES6 named parameter destructuring to re-name the `loading`, `error`, and `data` properties returned from `useMutation`'s payload'.

```javascript
const [
  createItem,
  { loading: createItemLoading, error: createItemError, data },
] = useMutation(CREATE_ITEM_MUTATION)
```

3. Call `createItem` in the form submission handler, `handleSubmit`.

```javascript
const handleSubmit = async e => {
  e.preventDefault()
  const res = await createItem({ variables: { ...formState } })
  // you can also perform re-directs, or call other helper functions here, as a
  // part of your form submission handler
}
```
