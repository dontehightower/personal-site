##### Update - useMutation to Update Items

Mini-Boss: To create a UI for updating Items, we need to write a Query called `item`, that returns a single item, and a new Mutation called `updateItem` for updating item that item.

To the `backend`!:

###### A Single Item Query

In `src/schema.graphql`, define a new Query that allows us to look up a single item, and a corresponding resolver:

`item` takes a single parameter, `ItemWhereUniqueInput`, which we borrow from prisma's generated schema, it can be found in `/generated/prisma.graphql`

```graphql
type Query {
  # added this line to old code
  item(where: ItemWhereUniqueInput!): Item
}
```

Our resolver for this query will use prisma-bindings's `forwardTo` function to delegate the query's execution to resolvers(generated by prisma) with the same name.The flow of execution looks something like this:

- Our Schema -> Our Resolver -> Prisma Generated Schema **easily readable** -> Prisma Generated Resolvers _presumably harder to read_\*, -> DB

-- The resolvers generated by prisma are the "magic" here. They are generated functions that are instructed to look at various locations of the database to return the requested data. Even if they are not harder to read, that's not the point. The point is `forwardTo("db")` says: "Look in our prisma service for the generated resolver, or set of generated resolvers necessary to resolve this query".

```javascript
const Query = {
  // added this line to old code
  item: forwardTo("db"),
}
```

###### An updateItem Mutation

Define Mutation in the `schema.graphql`

```graphql
type Mutation {
  # createItem is up here
  updateItem(id: ID!, title: String, description: String, price: Int): Item!
}
```

Write a resolver for that mutation in `src/resolvers/Mutation.js`
All the methods in our generated `prisma.graphql` API are exposed on `ctx.db`
Query methods are on `ctx.db.query` Mutations methods are on `ctx.db.mutation`.

```javascript
const Mutations = {
  // createItem code is up here...
  updateItem: async (parent, args, ctx, info) => {
    // take a copy of the updates
    const updates = { ...args }
    // remove the ID from the updates
    delete updates.id
    // run the update method
    return ctx.db.mutation.updateItem(
      {
        data: updates,
        where: {
          id: args.id,
        },
      },
      info
    )
  },
}
```

Meanwhile, on the `frontend`...

Make a new UpdateItem component. This will provide a form similar to the CreateItem component. The major difference are the removal of the upload file function, removal of the `<input type="file">`, and changing the `CREATE_ITEM_MUTATION` to an `UPDATE_ITEM_MUTATION`.
