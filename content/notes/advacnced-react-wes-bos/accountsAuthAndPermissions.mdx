# Accounts, Authorization, and Permissions

## Creating Users

enums are useful in GraphQL when something's type can be one of many distinct values.

add some fields to the user type

create Permission enum

```
enum Permission {
  ADMIN
  USER
  ITEMCREATE
  ITEMUPDATE
  ITEMDELETE
  PERMISSIONUPDATE
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String! @unique
  password: String
  resetToken: String
  resetTokenExpiry: String
  permissions: [Permission]
}
```

Create the signup Mutation in our schema

```
type Mutation {
  # our schema is growing. createItem, updateItem, and deleteItem are up here
  signup(email: String!, password: String!, name: String!): User!
}
```

The `signup` resolver is where we will perform password encryption, add the User to the database, create and sign the JWT, and send it in our response as a part of `ctx.response.cookie`.

> We're storing JWTs in cookies here. Should double check hasura blog to make sure this is secure. Regardless, dealing with JWTs requires some changes to our `backend/index.js`.

Here's the signup function from `resolvers/Mutation.js`

```javascript
signup: async (parent, args, ctx, info) => {
  args.email = args.email.toLowerCase()
  // hash the password
  const password = await bcrypt.hash(args.password, 10)
  // create the user in the database
  const user = await ctx.db.mutation.createUser(
    {
      data: {
        ...args,
        password,
        // set permissions
        permissions: { set: ["USER"] },
      },
    },
    info
  )
  // create the JWT
  const token = jwt.sign({ userId: user.id }, process.env.APP_SECRET)
  ctx.response.cookie("token", token, {
    httpOnly: true,
    maxAge: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365, // 1 year cookie
  })
  // return user to the browser
  return user
}
```

- Use `bcrypt` to perform one-way hashing of passwords.
- JWTs have to have a secret passed to them
- Our cookie is set to have a 1 year lifespan, however JWTs should have 15-min lifespan. Should check how to accomplish this.

Frontend `signup` uses a `<form>`. The form has 3 controlled inputs `name`, `email`, and `password` fields that share an event handler using ES6 Computed Property names similar to the Item Creation and Item Update forms. The main differences are:

1. The `<form method="post"`, this prevents the password from showing up in the URL as it does in GET requests.
2. The `handleSubmit` function clears the `formState`

Here's the `signup` Mutation:

```javascript
const SIGNUP_MUTATION = gql`
  mutation SIGNUP_MUTATION(
    $email: String!
    $name: String!
    $password: String!
  ) {
    signup(email: $email, name: $name, password: $password) {
      id
      email
      name
      password
    }
  }
`
```

## Display the Logged In User

1. Send JWT with each request
2. Decode JWT on backend
3. Add the `userId` to every request

We've created the user and sent a JWT back to the client as a part of our response. Now, we have to write server logic that checks our `cookies` for a `token` key, and verifies the `userId` if one is present:

```javascript src/index.js
server.express.use((req, res, next) => {
  const { token } = req.cookies
  if (token) {
    const { userId } = jwt.verify(token, process.env.APP_SECRET)
    // add userId to req for further requests to access
    req.userId = userId
  }
  next()
})
```

GraphQL Query for current User - `src/schema.graphql`

```
type Query {
  # item, item, itemsConnection ...
  me: User
}
```

```javascript
const Query = {
  // item resolvers up here
  me: (parent, args, ctx, info) => {
    // check if there is a current userId
    if (!ctx.request.userId) return null
    return ctx.db.query.user(
      {
        where: { id: ctx.request.userId },
      },
      info
    )
  },
}
```

Now that we've set up our GraphQL Query and Resolver on the backend, we can `useQuery` on the frontend to display that data in our Navbar:

```javascript
const Nav = () => {
  const {
    loading: currentUserLoading,
    error: currentUserError,
    data: currentUserData,
  } = useQuery(CURRENT_USER_QUERY)
  return (
    <NavStyles>
      {currentUserData ? <p>{currentUserData.me.name}</p> : null}
      {/* More Nav stuff going on down here */}
    </NavStyles>
  )
}
```

## Sign In + Custom Error Handling

- Use `refetchQueries` option on `useMutation` to have an immediate UI change after signing in.

```javascript
const [signin, { error, loading }] = useMutation(SIGNIN_MUTATION, {
  variables: formState,
  refetchQueries: [CURRENT_USER_QUERY],
})
```

## Sign Out Users
