# Maps

The maps application will randomly generate a User and Company and place them on a map. Three classes:

- Map
- User
- Company

Bundled with parcel.

Conevention: Any file who's primary purpose is to create and export a class, the file name will have a capital first letter.

Fields will be initialized on the same line if using a hard-coded value.

Import faker to generate user name, company name, company catchphrase and location

Importing faker caused an error: "could not find a declaration file for module faker".

**Explanation of error:** When writing typescript, we are free to make use of JS Libraries. However, the TypeScript compiler does want to check the types being used from JS libraries. _Type definition files_ serve as adapters by providing type definitions for the methods and modules of common JS libraries. [`@types/faker`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/faker) is the \_type definition file for the faker library.

Generally when creating a class in a TypeScript file, we do not perform any application-level logic operations inside that file. We export it into another file and work with the class from there.

TypeScript convention is not to use the `export default` statements. Instead, use named exports.

limiting access to class variables by wrapping `google.maps.Map` in a `CustomMap` class, and making the `googleMap` field `private`

```typescript
export class CustomMap {
  private googleMap: google.maps.Map // note the 'private' modifier

  constructor(divId: string) {
    this.googleMap = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById(divId), {
      zoom: 1,
      center: {
        lat: 0,
        lng: 0,
      },
    })
  }
  // ...
}
```
