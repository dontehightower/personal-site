### Definitions

- Type annotations: Code written by a developer that tells Typescript what type of value a variable will refer to.
- Type inference: Typescript tries to figure out what type of value a variable refers to.

### Annotations

#### Variables

```typescript
let apples: number = 5 // number
let speed: string = "fast" // string
let hasName: boolean = true // boolean

let nothingMuch: null = null // null
let nothing: undefined = undefined // undefined

// built in objects
let now: Date = new Date()
```

annotations can be used for every _primitive type_. Primitive types are:

- number
- boolean
- void
- undefined
- string
- symbol
- null

#### Object Literal annotations

#### Type Inference Rule

If variable declaration and variable initialization are performed on the same line, TypeScript will use the type of the initialized value to _infer_ the type of that variables

#### When to use Type Inference vs Type Annotations

Use type annotations in three scenarios:

1. When a Function returns an `any` type.
2. When declaring a variable on one line and initializing it later
3. Type cannot be inferred correctly

#### Type Annotations & Type Inferences in Functions

When writing functions in TypeScript, annotation and inference behavior may not work exactly as expected. TypeScript will only infer the return value of a function. It will not infer the types of a functions parameters. Because of this, we should annotate function parameter and return values.

Annotating Functional Expressions

```typescript
const add = (a: number, b: number): number => {
  return a + b
}
```

Function Declarations

```typescript
function divide(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a / b
}
```

Anonymous Functions

```typescript
function multiply = function(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a * b;
}
```

If a function does not return a value, use the void keyword

```typescript
const logger = (message: string): void => {
  console.log(message)
}
```

If a function is never expected to return anything use the never keyword

```typescript
const throwError = (message: string): never => {
  throw new Error(message)
}
```

Destructuring with annotations follow the following pattern:
`({ destructured, parameters}: {type1: Date, type: string}): void =>`

```typescript
const logWeather = ({
  date,
  weather,
}: {
  date: Date
  weather: string
}): void => {
  console.log(forecast.date)
  console.log(forecast.weather)
}
```

#### Arrays

TypeScript arrays are useful any time we need to represent a collection of records.
TS can perform type inference when extracting a value from an array.

Arrays where each element is some consistent type of value.

```typescript
const carMakers = ["ford", "toyota", "chevy"]
```

We can also annotate the values expected in an array.

```typescript
const carMakers: string[] = ["ford", "toyota", "chevy"]
```

Annotations are particularly useful when initializing an empty array.

```typescript
const carMakers: string = [] // values placed in this array should be strings
```

TS can perform type inference when extracting a value from an array. TS helps developers avoid placing incompatable values in an array.

```typescript
const carMakers: string[] = ["ford", "toyota", "chevy"]
const car = carMakers[0] // ts infers this value will be a string
carMakers.push(100) // "Argument of type '100' is not assignable to parameter of type string"
```

Special annotation can be used if we want to used a mix of types in an Arrays

```typescript
const importantDates: (Date | string)[] = [new Date(), "2018-19-02"]
```

#### Tuples

Array-like structure where each element represents some property of a record.

#### Interfaces

Interfaces are a TypeScript type aimed

#### Classes

A class is a blueprint to create an object with fields(_properties_) and methods(_functions_) to represent an object. When creating a class, we don't call the methods defined inside of it directly, instead we define an instance of class using the `new` keyword;

```typescript
class Vehicle {
  drive(): void {
    console.log("chugga chugga")
  }

  honk(): void {
    console.log("beep")
  }
}

const vehicle = new Vehicle()
vehicle.drive() // prints "chugga chugga"
vehicle.honk() // prints "beep"
```

TypeScript classes are similar to ES6 classes, but the inheritence model is different.

```typescript
class Vehicle {
  drive(): void {
    console.log("chugga chugga")
  }

  honk(): void {
    console.log("beep")
  }
}

// Car has all the methods of vehicle

// can optionally override methods on child classes
class Car extends Vehicle {
  drive(): void {
    console.log("vroom")
  }
}

const car = new Car()
const vehicle = new Vehicle()
vehicle.drive() // "chugga chugga"
car.drive() // "vroom"
```

###### Instance and Method Modifiers

One difference between ES6 JS classes and TS classes is the presence of instance and method Modifiers

- *public* - default method. means a method can be called anywhere
- *private* - this method can only be called by methods in the same class definition
- *protected* - can only be called by instances of the class

Cannot change method modifiers in child classes.

A Method can be marked as private to restrict the ability of other developers to call that method.
